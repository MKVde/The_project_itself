#
# # Automated GitHub repository
#
# This is a Python script that automates the process of creating a GitHub repository and pushing local code to it.

# ## Getting Started

# To get started, you will need the following:

# - OpenAI API credentials
# - GitHub credentials
# - Email credentials
# - The path to the Python script you want to upload

# ## Usage

# To use this script, first save it as a Python (`.py`) file. Then run the script, which will take care of the following:

# - Generate a README file using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model
# - Create the README file
# - Initialize the git repository
# - Add all files to the git repository
# - Commit the changes
# - Set the remote origin to the GitHub repository
# - Push the changes to the GitHub repository
# - Send an email notification with a link to the GitHub repository

# ## How it works

# The script starts by reading the Python script you want to upload and generating a README file using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. This README file is then saved in the same folder as the script.

# The next step is to create a git repository, add all the files to it, commit the changes, set the remote origin to the GitHub repository, and push the changes. Finally, an email notification is sent with a link to the GitHub repository.
